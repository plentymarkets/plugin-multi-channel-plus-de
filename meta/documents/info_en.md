# Plus.de

<div class="container-toc"></div>

In 2001, Plus.de was the first retailer of the German food industry to start an online business. Apart from the successful stationary shops, only a limited product selection from the Plus shops was offered on the internet initially. After the Plus shops were sold to Edeka/Netto in 2009, Plus was able to use a strong and reliable brand as a basis for online trade, enabling it to leave behind the multi-channel strategy.

Today, the Internet-Pure-Player offers its customers a vast, continually growing product range for little money. Now Plus.de presents itself as a universal supplier with more than 200,000 products, having its core competences in the sectors garden, furniture, household accessories, and do-it-yourself.
